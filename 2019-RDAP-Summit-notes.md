# Panel 1: Repositories and curation
**Thinking outside the repository: supporting partial curation
Speaker: Greg Janée (University of California, Santa Barbara)**


working with graduate students in environ. sci and management 
helping them to manage data sets 

added DMP requirements to school curric. 

what constitues data maangement? 
the end state?
what practices are sufficient 

DataOne best-practice guides 

**looking at FAIR-like principles for data management** 
* data management principles:
* Inventoried - inventory of datasets 
* descripbed -metadata, doc
* owned -responsible party is known
* structured - uniform structure
* controlled - access controlled
* tracked - code versioning, data versions
* clean - no extraneous content
* protected - storage redundancy (preservation)

are you working with data management problems that don't fit the deposit in repository paradigm?

**Using information architecture to combat biases in 
information systems 
Speaker: Megan O’Donnell (Iowa State University Library)**


Institutaional mimicry 
Pros
pre-built
familiar
showcasing 

cons 
university structure is complex

institutional mimicry: skewed and biased 


"showcasing"
is an important fuctnion of inst. repos 
provides easy access points to specific research 

not neutral - information systems are not neutral 

"design for diversity learning toolkit" - google it

**Developing metadata curation processes for data that 
can’t be shared openly
Speaker: Rebecca Grant (Springer Nature)
Co-authors: Graham Smith, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz 
(Springer Nature)**


practical challenges for reserchers in dta sharing white paper 

problems authors face in sharing dtata 
* organising dta in a presentable and userful way - main problem 
* unsure about copy right and licensing 
* not knowing which reo to use 

Springer nature has a data curation support 
* research data policies 
* research help desk 
* recommended repo list 

no one other than the creator can access the data, or even knows that it exists

springer nature - curates into figshare 


metadata curation output 
curated dataset will be published with its own metadata 

**challenges for data that can't be openly shared:**
* PII
* speicial categories of PII - GDPR
* data revealing location of rare endagered species 
* commercially sensitive data - relating to industrial partners or collected on their behalf 


assessing sensitivity of personal data - direct identifiers 

direct ident. relate directly to an individ. 

indirect identifiers - information that allows ident. of individ. thorough therir combo with other available info. 

gender, birth place, income, race ident.  etc. 


Journal data policies - require data sharing, or a data availability statement describing how data can be accessed 

* deident data 
* controlled access rpo
* shared data on request 


curation workflow 
* curation team connected with the author 
* advice on de-identification 
* advice on suitible disc. repos
* curator reads paper for data related info 
* add info requested 
* cureate creates rich metadata record in das 
* metadata and das reviewed an approved by author 

data reporting checklist in created in google forms 

authors were not responsive 
5-6 days too long 

* metadata collection 
* review of authors paper 
* short spreadsheet filled out by author 
* review of the authors datasets availble in other repos 
* email directly to the author is necessary 
* rich context info aotu data sets 
* a consistent format for the metaa we use to describe studies

RDAP, DataCure, ALA STS 

Job lists - Code4lib, IASSIST, DLF 

collected 178 postings 
181 positions 

carnegie classifications
phd 161, masters, 4, BA 8, special focus 5 
33% don't use librarian word


code= DMP 
2 attributes - complexity and location in posting 

analysis of code 
diverity, equity, and inclusion - appears in 42% of postings 
82% require mlis 66% equivalent degree 
3% prefer mlis 
15% don't require mlis 
8% require 
31% prefer additional degrees 

47% descriptive salary words 
25% min range for salary 

make your job postings more inclusive

**Bridging the Divides – A Mixed Method Investigation of 
Multidisciplinary Research Data Management Practices
Speaker: Shahira Khair (University of Victoria)
Co-authors: Jacqueline Quinless (University of Victoria)**

what data is being generated? 

whatis the current landscape?


do we know what direction we are moving in? 


Tri-agency RDM policy 
institutional strategy
data management plan 
data deposit 

created survey addressing data formats, storage, documentation, sharing 


key results - diversity, planning, documentation, storage and sharing





**Value in those dusty file cabinets? Identifying analog data 
from our campus community
Speaker: Shannon Farrell (University of Minnesota)
Co-authors: Julie Kelly, Kristen Mastel (University of 
Minnesota)**

paper data discussion 
departent did not want 100 year old potato breeding data 
what to do with it? 

talked ot various departments and organizations 

serveral questions were asked to find out more information from researchers 
 and need for the data

# Panel 3: Institutional and Domain Repositories: 
**Competitors, Complements, Collaborators?** 

**Discussion panelists:
Jake Carlson (University of Michigan), 

data curation partner network
mutual beneficial relationships between domain and institutional repos 



Thu-Mai Christian (Odum Institute for Research in 
Social Science), 
data archiving since 1965
preserving on a bit level - 

odum accepting datasets outside out of soc sci 
data types related to soc. sci.  



Wendy Kozlowski (Cornell University), 
Sebastian Karcher (Qualitative Data Repository)**



do researchers see discipline boundaries? 

what are some competitions? 

what are was for potential collaborations?

findability - 
send people to a better place to find out what exists 

how do researchers find data?  
federated searches are the primary way to  find data 

benefiting services to do more for the researchers served 


# RDAP DAY 2

### Panel 4: Community and data in the world

Development of Resident Participation in Biological 
Conservation
Speaker: Ali Krzton (Auburn University)**


data collection in biodiversity conservation research 



question for project:  how do practices surrounding data affect the particpation of locals? 

initial predictions:
language barriers would limit comm.
fold categories would be a poor match 


preliminary interviews 


cybertracker.org tool 
used conservation research - species identification 





**Distributed, Dynamic, Accessible: Cooperative Planning

how do folks use data 
how do poeple define data
how do we understand what is important 


commmunity

driven by participants
recurrent method - methods in action 
evaluation, planning, reflection, action 

collaboration, collective vision and structure meeting , time to reflect

**Responding to Data Sharing Dynamics in Community-
Based Research
Speaker: Nora (Eleanor) Mattern (University of Chicago)
Co-author: Aaron Brenner (University of Pittsburgh)**

digital scholarship unit - RDC group 

data inequities in community research
what is shared 
who has access 
 underlying these, different perspectives on why data is important 
 
 
central principles of community based participatory research (CPBR)

in CPBR - data are shared, researchers and community decide how they will be used and disseminated 

access to research data is often either enabled or constrained by formalized roles.  

consider who has PI of co-investigator status 

data access-

climate gentrifiation 
scientist proved there is an need 


miami communities:
coconut grove, overtown 
liberty city 

low income communities site on higher ground 17' 

data shows lack renter rights, cannot protect themselves from corps.  

no public transportation in neighbothoods 

"weather safe" - no such thing 
hight of elevation is 17' 

poverty sticken comunities on high elevation, becoming expensive areas.
