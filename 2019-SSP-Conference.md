# 2019-SSP-Conference



Scientific communication is more than just the publication of manuscripts; publishers have always strived to provide value-added features to their journal offerings. With the growing competition in journal publications, the impetus to improve value—as perceived by authors—has only increased. There are many exciting new initiatives: graphical and video abstracts, plain language summaries, podcasts, etc. However, the selection, planning, and execution of new initiatives can be challenging. This panel of speakers has been brought together to share their knowledge and experience with new communication initiatives—particularly multimedia projects—in journal publishing. We’ll cover the challenges of launching these projects and provide actionable solutions, such as key content for author guidelines as well as author resources and examples. Issues covered in each case will provide knowledge on broad themes applicable to any new communication initiative that requires educating authors, fostering their interest, and facilitating their participation.
